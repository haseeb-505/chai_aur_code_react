#### why are we using useCallback hook here?

You're right that the functionality of the password generator could be achieved without useCallback. However, useCallback is used to optimize performance in certain scenarios by memoizing a function. Here's why it's used in your code:

Purpose of useCallback
Memoization of Function: useCallback ensures that the generate_password function is only recreated if one of its dependencies (length, includeNumbers, or includeCharacters) changes. If none of these values change, React will reuse the previously memoized function instead of creating a new one.

Preventing Unnecessary Re-Renders: If you were passing the generate_password function as a prop to child components (which is not the case here, but could be in a more complex scenario), those components would re-render every time the parent component renders, even if the function hasn't changed. By using useCallback, you prevent unnecessary re-renders of those child components.

When useCallback is Useful
Expensive Functions: If the function you are memoizing is computationally expensive and you don't want to recompute it on every render unless necessary, useCallback helps save those cycles.

Function as Prop: When passing functions down to child components, useCallback ensures that the function reference remains stable unless the dependencies change. This avoids unnecessary re-renders of the child components.

In Your Case
In your current implementation:

Optimization: Since generate_password is relatively lightweight and isn't passed as a prop, useCallback is not strictly necessary. The app would still work fine without it. However, if you expect to extend your app in the future where this function might become more complex or passed to child components, useCallback would then provide performance benefits.
If you remove useCallback, the generate_password function will be recreated on every render, but it won't significantly impact the performance in your current setup.
